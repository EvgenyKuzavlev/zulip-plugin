<div>
    <p>When checked, notification messages will include the full path of the job, including parent directories and
        parent jobs, with a link to each of them.</p>
    <p>This is especially useful for multi-branch pipelines: the message will include both the name of the pipeline
        and the name of the branch, instead of just the name of the branch.</p>
    <p>
        For example in a multi-branch pipeline job named "My Job",
        for a notification on branch "main":
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>with this option left unchecked, the notification message will start with "Project: main"</li>
        <li>with this option checked, the notification message will start with "Project: My Job Â» main"</li>
    </ul>
</div>
