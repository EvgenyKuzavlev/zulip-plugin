	<p>You almost certainly don't need to change this, but if you have
    a custom subdomain for your Humbug instance, put it here.  This
    value is used to build the URL used when interacting with the
    Humbug API. For example, if your Humbug URL is
    "http://mysubdomain.humbughq.com", the subdomain setting should be
    "mysubdomain".</p>
