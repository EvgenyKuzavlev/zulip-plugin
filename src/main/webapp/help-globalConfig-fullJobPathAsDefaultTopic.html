    <p>When checked, the topic will default to the full path of the job, including parent directories and parent
        jobs.</p>
    <p>This only has an effect when no topic is configured explicitly.</p>
    <p>This is especially useful for multi-branch pipelines: the topic will include both the name of the pipeline
        and the name of the branch, instead of just the name of the branch.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example in a multi-branch pipeline job named "My Job",
        for a notification on branch "main":
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>with this option left unchecked, the topic will default to "main"</li>
        <li>with this option checked, the topic will default to "My Job Â» main"</li>
    </ul>
</div>
